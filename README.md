## What is MLOps?

**MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)** is a set of practices that combines Machine Learning, DevOps, and Data Engineering to deploy and maintain ML models in production reliably and efficiently.

### Key Definition

> MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, automating and streamlining the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle—from data collection and model training to deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

### Core Objectives

- 🚀 **Accelerate** time-to-market for ML models
- 🔄 **Automate** the ML pipeline from development to production
- 📊 **Monitor** model performance and detect drift
- 🔧 **Maintain** models with continuous training and updates
- 🤝 **Collaborate** across data science, engineering, and operations teams

---

## Why MLOps?

### The Problem

According to recent research, many ML initiatives fail to reach production due to:

- **Lack of reproducibility** in experiments and training
- **Data and model drift** causing performance degradation
- **Scalability challenges** when moving from prototype to production
- **Collaboration gaps** between data scientists and operations teams
- **Governance and compliance** concerns in regulated industries

### The Solution

MLOps provides:

✅ **Reproducibility**: Version control for code, data, and models  
✅ **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines for ML workflows  
✅ **Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of model performance  
✅ **Governance**: Audit trails and compliance frameworks  
✅ **Scalability**: Infrastructure to handle production workloads  

### Business Impact

## Core Principles

MLOps extends DevOps with four fundamental principles:

### 🔄 Continuous Integration (CI)

- Automated testing of code, data schemas, and models
- Version control for all ML assets
- Integration of new features and improvements

### 🚀 Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD)

- Automated deployment of ML pipelines
- Seamless promotion from staging to production
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### 📚 Continuous Training (CT)

*Unique to MLOps*

- Automatic retraining with new data
- Scheduled or trigger-based updates
- Maintaining model relevance over time

### 📊 Continuous Monitoring (CM)

- Real-time performance tracking
- Data quality monitoring
- System health and resource utilization
